### Using SFML for my project to create an animation.

Better to use a build tool like CMake. Having said that, this is how you will compile the program:
- Go inside `/bin` and run `../compile.bat` to compile the program.
- The executable `animation.exe` will be generated in `/bin`. 
- Run the executable.
